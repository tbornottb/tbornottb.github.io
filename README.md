## Hello, stranger!

### Unfortunately, none of my code work (from class and internships) is public, so this GitHub is going to look pretty bare. But I invite you to check out this collection of some of my non-code work:

### https://tbornottb.github.io/

### You can also find a copy of my resume [here!](https://github.com/tbornottb/tbornottb.github.io/blob/master/Trey2014Resume.pdf?raw=true)
