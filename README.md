## Pracitcal Invention CAD

####A device of my own design, the Keyper. It adheres to the front of a light switch and only allows the light to be turned on by the insertion and turning of a room key. Compatible for roommates, if either or both of the keys are inserted, the lights are on, and if both are removed, the lights are off. This was created to encourage people to not leave the lights on when leaving the room, as students take their room key with them.

## Wearables

#### These pieces, among others, were modeled for the fashion magazine FORM, to demonstrate the breadth of the applications of 3D printing and to bridge the fields of technology and art. All the pieces shown here were printed.
